    This is the start of the first project with The Odin Project. I will be making a website that has recipes. I don't have much to say right now, but will reflect on my progress at the end of the project. 

    I will create the website using basic html. 

    This is my second go at making a readme and trying to get it to commit to github. Hopefully this will work this time!

    I got it to work! I've learned some CSS so am going to style it a bit using the external method of CSS.
